This repository contains the code developed for the paper:

**De Domenico, F., Caccioli, F., & Livan, G. (2025). Peer influence breaks ergodicity in an opinion dynamics model with external information. arXiv preprint arXiv:2507.06661.** 

The main script, **`ensemble_simulation.py`**, implements an agent-based model of binary opinion dynamics, where agents balance social conformity and responsiveness to an external stochastic signal. The code supports both memory-less and memory-based versions of the model, reproducing core results from the paper, including ensemble and temporal averages across multiple simulations.
The simulations are designed to explore ergodicity-breaking transitions and compute observables such as the ensemble mean of agent states, with visual outputs saved for further analysis and reproducibility.
